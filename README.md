# 🧠 PsychTech Nexus

**Welcome! You have found the bridge between Psychology and Code.**

If you are a psychology student looking at this page, you might be thinking: *"I am not a coder, I shouldn't be here."*

**You are exactly where you need to be.** I built this repository because I used to be in your shoes. I realized that as psychology students, we are already data scientists—we just use different tools (like SPSS or Excel). This hub helps you translate that knowledge into Python and Computational Neuroscience.

## 📂 How to use this repository
I have organized the folders by difficulty, not by topic.

* **00_Start_Here:** Read the "Psych-to-Code" Cheat Sheet first.
* **01_The_Basics:** Simple notebooks connecting Excel concepts to Python.
* **02_Data_Analysis:** Real behavioral data analysis examples.
* **03_Comp_Neuro:** Models of the brain (math-heavy, but fun!).

## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I'm **Lala Jafarova**. I transitioned from Psychology to Cognitive Science & Tech. I am documenting my journey here to make yours easier.
